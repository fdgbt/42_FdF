*** INSTALL ***

-> Go to the FdF folder and execute the command "make".


*** USAGE ***

 ./fdf test_maps/42.fdf

-> The file path must be standard as following: folder/filename.format
-> The ".fdf" format is NOT mandatory.
-> Only one map can be opened by an instance (see Tips).


*** OPTIONS USAGE ***

 ./fdf -h [test_maps/42.fdf]
 
 ./fdf [-v] [-z] [-r1] test_maps/42.fdf


*** OPTIONS HELP ***

[ ]| Optional
   |	Means that the argument is facultative for usage.
   | Warning
   |	Each option must be activated only one time. 
   |    They can be used in any order and combined together.
   | Examples
   |	./fdf test_maps/42.fdf -v
   |	./fdf -v test_maps/42.fdf
   |	./fdf test_maps/42.fdf -vz -r2
   |	./fdf -vr2 test_maps/42.fdf -z

-h | Help
   |	Print install + usage + options description + controls + tips.
   | Warning
   |	Using this option will automatically quit the program without to display the map.

-v | Verbose
   |	Print with contextualized colors the different steps and principal values.
   |	Helpfull for debugging or educational explanations.

-z | auto-Zoom
   |	Disable the automated zoom at starting.
   | Warning
   |    Automated zoom is enabled by default.
   |    It reduces the size of the map to fit into the screen.
   |	auto-Zoom and auto-Resolution are two independants functionalities.

-r | auto-Resolution
   |	Force the resolution of the screen at starting.
   | Tips
   |	You must specify a number corresponding to the following resolution :
   |	   r1 -> 720 * 480 pixels   - SD. 
   |	   r2 -> 800 * 600 pixels   - Standard 4/3. 
   |	   r3 -> 1280 * 720 pixels  - HD.
   |	   r4 -> 1920 * 1080 pixels - Full HD.
   |	   r5 -> 3840 * 2160 pixels - 4K.
   | Example
   |	./fdf -r5 test_maps/42.fdf
   | Warning
   |	Force the resolution will disable the automated resolution at starting.
   |	-r0, -r6, -r7, -r8, -r9 has no effect. Others values will result by an error.
   |	auto-Resolution and auto-Zoom are two independants functionalities.


*** KEYBOARD CONTROLS ***

H		| hide the HUD.

SPACE		| enable hidden-face.

CTRL LEFT	| switch projection between:
		| 1. Isometric (Axonometric)
		| 2. Cabinet (Oblique)
		| 3. Perspective (1-point).

PAGE UP 	| zoom the map.

PAGE DOWN	| unzoom the map.

START		| increase the height of the map.

END		| decrease the height of the map.

ARROW UP	| translate the map by X axis.

ARROW DOWN	| translate the map by -X axis (reverse).

ARROW RIGHT	| translate the map by Y axis.

ARROW LEFT	| translate the map by -Y axis (reverse).

Z		| rotate the map by X axis.

S		| rotate the map by -X axis (reverse).

D		| rotate the map by Y axis.

Q		| rotate the map by -Y axis (reverse).

E		| rotate the map by Z axis.

A		| rotate the map by -Z axis (reverse).

DEL		| reset parameters to default.

ESC		| quit properly the program.


*** MOUSE CONTROLS ***

LEFT   BUTTON (HOLD)   | rotate the map.

RIGHT  BUTTON (HOLD)   | translate the map.

MIDDLE BUTTON (SCROLL) | zoom the map.

-> Note that multiple buttons press is WELL managed.


*** TIPS ***

- Mac OS install (keyboard fix) :
	Before to compile, remove all the Linux masks and replace with '0' to make the keyboard work properly.
		Then compile normally the program with the command "make".
		See "mlx_hook" below for more details.
	Example for MacOs :
		mlx_hook(conf->win_ptr, 0, 0, ft_press_key, conf);

- mlx_hook :
	Example for Linux :
		mlx_hook(conf->win_ptr, KeyPress, KeyPressMask, ft_press_key, conf);
	Linux masks used :
		KeyPress (2)       , KeyPressMask (1L<<0)
		ButtonPress (4)    , ButtonPressMask (1L<<2)
		ButtonPress (5)    , ButtonReleaseMask (1L<<3)
		MotionNotify (6)   , PointerMotionMask (1L<<6)
		Expose (12)        , ExposureMask (1L<<15)
		DestroyNotify (17) , StructureNotifyMask (1L<<17)
	For additional Linux masks, see :
		X11/Xlib.h
		http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_1.3.0/gLSB/gLSB/libx11-ddefs.html

- mlx_get_data_addr :
	bpp    = bits per pixels
	size_l = nb bytes used to store one line in memory
	endian = little endian (0) or big endian (1)

- Invalid or missing numbers in the maps are converted to 0.

- The name of the file is displayed in the title of the window.

- The map is automatically placed in the center of the window.

- Split your terminal and start a new fdf instance to visualize various map at the same time.

- Press "[CMD] + [C]" in the terminal to force quit in case of emergency.

- For other issue or additionnal request, please contact the support team (see "auteur" file).
